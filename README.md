# Coded phase-shift 3D scanner[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pranavkantgaur/CodedPhaseShift3DScanner.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pranavkantgaur/CodedPhaseShift3DScanner)

## Overview
This is C++ implementation of a 3D-scanner based on structured light approach. Specifically, it implements the sinusoidal fringe pattern based 3D scanning approach, originally proposed by Song Zhang in 2006. Code is currently in development stage(may not compile).

## Dependencies
It has following dependencies:
* [OpenCV](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv)
* [Point cloud library](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/)
